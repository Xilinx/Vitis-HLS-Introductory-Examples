This example illustrates the effect of misaligned data in the interface. Struct A defined in example.h has a 
size of 192 bits / 24 Bytes. As the port is defined as m_axi, Vitis HLS will pad this field to the closest 
power of 2 - which is 256 bits (or 32 bytes). This causes a mismatch in the software and hardware sizes and
results in II violations in the two loops that read and write to the m_axi interfaces.

Edit example.h to uncomment the line that sizes the struct to a power of 2. Rerun and observe that the II
violations are no longer there as the interfaces are properly sized and aligned.
