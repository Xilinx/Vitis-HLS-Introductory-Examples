This example uses a FRP (free-ruuning pipeline) mode to configure the pipeline architecture using a global command which is useful in reducing control logic fanout in vivado.

The Pipeline architecture can be implemented in 3 modes:
- FRP (free-ruuning pipeline)
- FLP (flushable pipeline)
- STP (stall pipeline)
