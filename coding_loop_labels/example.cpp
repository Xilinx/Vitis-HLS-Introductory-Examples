/* This example shows the value of using loop labels as part of algorithm capture 
 * for Vivado HLS.
 * Both of the examples shown below are functionally equivalent. The difference is
 * in how directives can be applied to optimize the design. 
 * Directives are the main method to add tool commands for hardware level optimization
 * without having to incur the cost of a code modfication. In AutoESL, directives have
 * to be attached to a label. 
 */

/* example_no_label will show the for loop as for in the directive panel. 
 * At the time a directive is applied to this loop,Vivado HLSwill suggest and prompt
 * for a loop label name. Inserting the required loop label will change the original
 * source code.
