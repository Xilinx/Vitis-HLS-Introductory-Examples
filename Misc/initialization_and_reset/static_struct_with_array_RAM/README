This example shows how static arrays are mapped to RAMs with different implementations 
and how they are initialized as well as how they are reset.

Things to note:
----------------
[A] In solution_A, you can see that for BRAM/LUTRAM, the following structure is 
    generated in the RTL to initialize the static RAM arrays:
    
    proj/solution_A/syn/verilog/test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W.v:
    initial begin
        $readmemh("./test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W.dat", ram);
    end

    proj/solution_A/syn/verilog/test_B_V_RAM_2P_LUTRAM_1R1W.v:
    initial begin
        $readmemh("./test_B_V_RAM_2P_LUTRAM_1R1W.dat", rom0);
    end

    The *.dat files contain the initial values for the respective arrays.

[B] In solution_B, you can see the structure that is generatd for BRAM/LUTRAM when
    they are reset:

    When the reset directive/pragma is applied to the static arrays (A/B/C), you will see 
    that in the generated RTL, both a ROM and a RAM are used to implement each memory. 
    The initial value is loaded to the ROM only (as in solution_A). But each time after the 
    reset signal is asserted, if an address is not written, the value read from the address 
    is from the ROM, otherwise it is read from the RAM. That means the memory is reset back 
    to the initialized value after each reset. The same structure below can be seen for all 
    two arrays A/B.

    proj/solution_B/syn/verilog/test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W.v:
    //------------------------Instantiation------------------
    test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W_ram #(
        .DataWidth(DataWidth),
        .AddressWidth(AddressWidth),
        .AddressRange(AddressRange))
    test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W_ram_u(
        .address0       ( address0 ),
        .ce0            ( ce0 ),
        .q0             ( q0_ram ),
        .address1       ( address1 ),
        .ce1            ( ce1 ),
        .we1            ( we1 ),
        .d1             ( d1 ),
        .clk            ( clk ),
        .reset          ( reset )
     );
     test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W_rom #(
        .DataWidth(DataWidth),
        .AddressWidth(AddressWidth),
        .AddressRange(AddressRange))
     test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W_rom_u(
        .ce0      ( ce0 ),
        .address0 ( address0 ),
        .q0       ( q0_rom ),
        .clk      ( clk ),
        .reset    ( reset )
     );
     //------------------------Body---------------------------
     assign q0     = q0_sel? q0_ram : q0_rom;

[C] In solution_C, you can see the same structure as solution_B. Only difference is that we used
    a "config_rtl -reset state" command instead of the reset pragmas/directives.
