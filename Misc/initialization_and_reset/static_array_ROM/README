This example shows how static arrays are mapped to ROMs with different implementations 
and how they are initialized.

Things to note:
----------------
[A] In solution_A, you can see that for both BRAM/LUTRAM, the following structure is generated in the RTL
    to initialize the static ROM array:
    
    proj/solution_A/syn/verilog/test_A_V_ROM_1P_BRAM_1R.v:
    initial begin
        $readmemh("./test_A_V_ROM_1P_BRAM_1R.dat", rom0);
    end

    proj/solution_A/syn/verilog/test_B_V_ROM_1P_LUTRAM_1R.v
    initial begin
        $readmemh("./test_B_V_ROM_1P_LUTRAM_1R.dat", rom0);
    end

    The *.dat files contain the initial values for the respective arrays. Also note that URAM is not a supported
    implementation type for ROMs.
