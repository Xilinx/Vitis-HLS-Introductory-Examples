This example shows how global arrays are mapped to RAMs with different implementations 
and how they are initialized as well as how they are reset.

Things to note:
----------------
[A] In solution_A, you can see that for BRAM/LUTRAM, the following structure is 
    generated in the RTL to initialize the global RAM arrays (URAM is not supported):
    
    proj/solution_A/syn/verilog/test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W.v:
    initial begin
        $readmemh("./test_A_V_RAM_2P_BRAM_1R1W.dat", ram);
    end

    proj/solution_A/syn/verilog/test_B_V_RAM_2P_LUTRAM_1R1W.v:
    initial begin
        $readmemh("./test_B_V_RAM_2P_LUTRAM_1R1W.dat", ram);
    end 

    The *.dat files contain the initial values for the respective arrays.
    
    Also note that global arrays are NOT exported to the interface. 
    WARNING: [RTGEN 206-101] Global array 'B_V' will not be exposed as RTL port.
    WARNING: [RTGEN 206-101] Global array 'A_V' will not be exposed as RTL port.

[B] In solution_B, you can see the structure that is generated for BRAM/LUTRAM when
    they are reset:

    When the reset directive/pragma is applied to the static arrays (A/B/C), you will see 
    that in the generated RTL, both a ROM and a RAM are used to implement each memory. 
    The initial value is loaded to the ROM only (as in solution_A). But each time after the 
    reset signal is asserted, if an address is not written, the value read from the address 
    is from the ROM, otherwise it is read from the RAM. That means the memory is reset back 
    to the initialized value after each reset. The same structure below can be seen for all 
    three arrays A/B/C.
